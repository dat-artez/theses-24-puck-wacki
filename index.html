        Art’s Dance with Time: Transcending a Linear Nature

        <br>

        <!-- opening quote -->
        Time present and time past
        Are both perhaps present in time future.
        And time future contained in time past.
        If all time is eternally present
        All time is unredeemable.
        -T.S. Eliot, “burnt Norton”1

        <!-- introduction -->

        A minute has 60 seconds, an hour has 60 minutes, a day 24 hours and a year has 365 days. And then again and
        again
        in an infinite cycle of rhythmic patterns. But what is this measurement of time? In reality, there are
        different
        definitions of time: scientific time or clock time (used to divide our lives into units) and time felt, our
        own
        perception of time passing. Often, we feel like time is flying by, that there is never enough time. When in
        2020
        COVID hit, everything felt like an endless cycle of nothingness. How is it that we can measure something
        called
        time, but this fixed measurement isn’t in sync with our own feeling of the duration of time?
        Is our language behind, on the fast pace of our technological developments? With the introduction of the
        Industrial Revolution, we constructed Western society around a machine (the clock) based on natural phenomena
        that
        we lived by. These natural phenomena, the rising and setting of the sun, the position of the moon and its
        tides,
        were eventually put aside. We have become slaves of our own invention.
        We think of art within space, whereas time is most often seen as the boundary of deadlines for the duration of
        an
        artwork. But isn’t art more a way to occupy time rather than space? This is the question that curators Hans
        Ulrich
        Obrist and Philippe Parreno asked in the 2007 exhibition “Il Tempo del Postino”.2 In this thesis I am going
        through the misconception of time, where I highlight the beauty of the anti-clock – conceptions of time that
        go
        against clock-time – in intentional or in unintentional artworks. Where I ask the question; Can art change or
        manipulate our experience of time, can we find beauty in works that consciously or unconsciously play with our
        feeling, perception and the idea of the anti-clock? Through three different case studies, I will try to
        demonstrate how this concept should be implemented within art.


        <!-- overview / cahpter 1 -->

        A Western View on a Western Time

        Time has no unity.
        Time as western man knows it can be traced back to the International System of Units (SI), where a second is
        based
        on the vibrations of the cesium-133 atom.3 This definition allows for extremely precise and accurate
        timekeeping.
        But what is this rhythmic repetition of vibrations?

        In 1907 Henri Bergson developed the theory of duration, where duration is a theory of time and consciousness.4
        He
        divided time into the concept of science and that of humanity. For the individual, time may speed up or slow
        down,
        whereas, for science, it would remain the same.

        Until 1905 this definition of scientific time may have been true, based on Isaac Newton's notion of absolute
        time.
        He believed that there was one time, and that this time would be the same everywhere, for whoever measured
        it.5
        Before Newton, time for humanity was the way of counting how things changed. Before Newton, no one had thought
        it
        possible that a time independent of things could exist.6

        However, an absolute time is also not true for the scientific field. In 1905 Einstein came up with the theory
        of
        special relativity where time is considered relative.7 This means that each observer has his own measurement
        of
        time. By speeding up or slowing down time changes.

        This scientific notion of time, that is mathematically composed plays a big role in human lives.
        So, time is not absolute, it changes depending on speed and mass. But how is it that we live by one fixed
        time,
        the clock, a machine that had a radical influence on the social construct of human society?
        We see time as the clock, but the clock and time are not the same thing. Clocks have given us the ability to
        agree
        on what time is, a universal time. They create an objectification of time, a social invention, a construct of
        the
        human mind. We can’t see, hear, smell or touch time. We have no way of sensing it at all.8 It is an act to
        control
        and perfect. There is no such thing as the sense of time.
        Lewis Mumford, a philosopher of technology, wrote this about the effect the clock had on the actions of man in
        his
        essay “Technics and Civilisation” of 1934:
        <!-- block quote -->
        … the clock is not merely a means of keeping track of the hours, but of synchronizing the actions of men.
        Where
        Abstract time became the new medium of existence. Organic functions themselves were regulated by it: one ate,
        not
        upon feeling hungry, but when prompted by the clock: one slept, not when one was tired, but when the clock
        sanctioned it.9
        <!-- einde block quote -->
        George Woodcock, a Canadian writer, later elaborated on this in his essay “The Tyranny of the Clock” in 1944,
        where he not only talks about the act it has on man but also its beginning of capitalism:
        <!-- block quote -->
        The clock turns time from a process of nature into a commodity that can be measured and bought and sold like
        soap
        or sultanas. And because, without some means of exact timekeeping, industrial capitalism could never have
        developed and could not continue to exploit the workers, the clock represents an element of mechanical tyranny
        in
        the lives of modern men more potent than any individual exploiter or any other machine.10
        <!-- einde block quote -->
        So, with the rise of the clock, we became slaves of our own invention. It was an extension of man that we used
        it
        as a tool to control man as an act to become “better”. Here we lost our rhythmic life of a natural being. In
        the
        words of Woodcock, “we became the servant of the concept of time”.11
        Is there a way out? What did Bergson mean when he said, “for the individual, time may speed up or slowdown”?12
        As
        individuals we can feel a different kind of time, our emotions can distort our sense of time. We have some
        kind of
        clock in our brain that when we feel bored, stressed or lonely we obsessively count every beat. But when are
        busy,
        relaxed or social our mind is doing other stuff and therefore it will skip a lot of beats so it seems like
        time is
        flying by.13
        There are no clear conclusions on how humans experience time. But there is a general understanding of the
        order of
        time, with the future in front of us and the past behind.14 We have constructed everything around us, our
        whole
        lives, in this linear way. But linear time is just clock time as Arie Altena said15 – it was created to serve
        a
        capitalistic world.
        In an interview with Arie Altena for the book Time Travelling musician Hilary Jeffry said: “When music is read
        through notation in the Western tradition, it is typically done so in a linear fashion.”16 Western music
        scores
        are rhythmic scores that only go forward. It is based on clock time constructed using the rhythm of a
        metronome.
        It is the same for our language. Language happens one sybil after another. Therefore we also listen in a
        linear
        way. We recognize sounds as words that are pronounced one after the other. Without the one before or after we
        can’t make a sentence and therefore wouldn’t be able to communicate.

        <!-- eind general overvieuw introducting arivel -->

        This linear approach of our language and how it affects our experience of time is illustrated in the movie
        “Arrival”.17 The movie offers a new perspective on how our linear language shapes our understanding of the
        past,
        present, and future. The film is about the problem of contact, of translation, the impossibility of
        communication
        between two incommensurable worlds – human language and that of the aliens. The Heptopods, the alien species,
        have
        landed in twelve countries and sent incomprehensible messages, prompting the urgent need for deciphering and
        understanding their intentions. The protagonist, a linguist, alongside her colleague, has been given the task
        to
        decipher the language of the aliens and communicate with them in order to understand their intentions. During
        this
        time pressure arises from impatient politicians, who would prefer to solve the problem with aggressive
        solutions.
        The assumption is made that the aliens must have a language and a form of writing to understand one another.
        The
        first contact is made by the humans introducing themselves by writing the letters of the alphabet onto signs
        and
        writing words, such as human, and then pointing to herself and her college. The aliens accept this offer of
        communication and create curious signs from their toes with the help of an ink-like fluid. With this, an
        intensive
        deciphering process begins under constant political pressure to resort to force.

        Each of these signs, with which the aliens communicate, is based on the circle, a structural order contrasting
        significantly with the linear structure of human language represented by the alphabet and speech sounds. While
        humans can only express themself discursively within a chronological sequence based on the dimension of time,
        the
        aliens are able to communicate in a synchronous order, facilitated by their circular nature of language, in
        which
        there is no beginning and end, nor a before and after. By studying their language and trying to understand it,
        the
        protagonist gains a form of perception that transcends time, in which the past, the present, and the future
        flow
        together at once. The film highlights the potential liberation in transcending linear thinking, extending
        beyond
        mortal boundaries such as death.

        The science-fiction film “Arrival” looks at the limits of human thought. What now resolves around our human
        ability and consciousness to only see time linearly. It takes us into a possible evolution of the human brain,
        which will allow humanity to experience a new way of thinking in forms that transcend time.18 The whole social
        construct of life is based on this linear way of thinking, it is always one after the other, and one or the
        other
        (binary). We cannot see time as something that happens simultaneously. So, if everything we know becomes this
        linear/binary way of thinking,19 are we even willing to see time as something that is not, are we able to
        accept…?

        <!-- eind linear na circulair now introducting the idea of quantum physics -->


        Take at quantum theory for example. I will not look into the scientific explanation of it but rather at the
        different perspectives it can give us. Our machine and technology-based society exists out of data information
        that is constructed out of 0s and 1s. It’s binary. It is always one or the other, it is never both. So,
        information is consistently processed sequentially, one item at a time, allowing us to perceive change in the
        present moment. But this is again a linear way of thinking. The main principle of quantum theory is the idea
        that
        something is not 0 or 1, but it is them both at the same time, also called the Superposition. This is the
        ability
        of a quantum system to be in multiple states at the same time until it is measured. So, everything is and
        happens
        simultaneously. It has no specific place and time. This is a very rich perspective that can help us move away
        from
        our linear way of thinking. The development of quantum computing can compute everything at the same time,
        contrary
        to a normal computer where every action happens at a super-fast speed one after the other. It feels like it
        happens instantly, because it happens faster than a human can experience, but this is not the case whereas for
        quantum computing it is.

        But now they are writing systems to use these quantum computers to get the best possible result out of the
        input.
        So yet again looking for one outcome after the other. To find the best out of everything the fastest. But we
        should look at how can we use or see this perception of different time. Is it not something new and beautiful,
        something that has no specific time and or place? It is not 0 or 1. It is all of it everywhere at the same
        time.
        No construct to move forward to be better to find that one perfect answer. It is an act we don’t seem to
        recognize
        for the beauty that it has, an act to deconstruct our perception of what time can be.

        <!-- introduction of the examples to put time circulair instead of linear -->

        So, the reality of what we think time is, is simply an interpretation of our perception that we created. I
        think
        that by taking time as an individual to look at art, we can find new and different perspectives that we
        otherwise
        would have never seen because our perspective is set to what we think time is. And therefore, I want to ask
        the
        question: Can art change or manipulate our experience of time, can we find beauty in works that consciously or
        unconsciously play with our feeling, perception and the idea of the anti-clock? The following case studies
        will
        demonstrate different perspectives.


        <!-- first example -->
        On Circular Time and Repetition
        <!-- question -->

        Is a circular time a kind of repetition or an act to blend out irregularities?

        <!-- now comes image -->




        In his work I am sitting in a room (1969), artist Alvin Lucier is sitting in a room. He speaks a text into a
        microphone, attempting to smooth out his stutter:
        <!-- this is a block quote -->
        I am sitting in a room different from the one you are in now. I am recording the sound of my speaking voice
        and I
        am going to play it back into the room again and again until the resonant frequencies of the room reinforce
        themselves so that any semblance of my speech, with perhaps the exception of rhythm is destroyed. What you
        will
        hear, then, are the natural resonant frequencies of the room articulated by speech. I regard this activity not
        so
        much as a demonstration of a physical fact, but more as a way to smooth out any irregularities my speech might
        have.20
        <!-- end block quote -->
        I am sitting in a room is a work that reflected differently on the meaning of space and time. It goes through
        the
        motion of audio and repetition by man-made machines. Speaking into a microphone, recording onto
        electromagnetic
        tape, which is subsequently played back through speakers and re-recorded onto electromagnetic tape.

        Lucier talks about the relationship between sound and space. He is interested in the transformation of speech
        within a space, the resonance of the room. He performs the same text in different places, where every space
        has
        its own resonance. This influences the length (number of repetitions) to blend out his speech and the sound
        representation of that room. All factors in a room and the room itself have influence on the piece. While the
        physical ‘space’ stays the ‘same’ during the duration of the piece, the perception over time is changing
        through
        the act of repetition and mediation through the technology (man-made machines) he uses.

        The duration of the piece influences our perception by the repetition that unfolds over time. It blurs out our
        Western idea of language, something we perceive in a linear way. Our language consists of audio – hearable
        waves
        called frequencies – that can form compositions that we call words. Arranging words sequentially creates the
        feeling of progressing through time, where we can look ‘back’ at the words that have already passed. Saint
        Augustine, a theologian and philosopher, describes this by a hymn in his XIth book, The Confessions:
        <!-- block quote -->
        When we listen to a hymn, the meaning of a sound is given by the ones that come before and after it. Music can
        occur only in time, but if we are always in the present moment, how is it possible to hear it?21
        <!-- end block quote -->
        Carlo Rovelli explained Augustine’s observation in his book The Order of Time as follows:
        <!-- block quote -->
        It is possible, Augustine observes, because our consciousness is based on memory and on anticipation. A hymn,
        a
        song, is in some way present in our minds in a unified form, held together by something—by that which we take
        time
        to be. And hence this is what time is: it is entirely in the present, in our minds, as memory and as
        anticipation.22
        <!-- eind block quote -->
        By the repetition through the technology in the room, the audio loses its original frequency and blends in
        with
        the frequency of the room. Through this action, Lucier blends out every irregularity within his speech. This
        is
        where we leave the linear line. If the speech ages out and only the resonance of the room is left and you keep
        on
        repeating this action, there is no way for someone to know where it starts and where it ends. There is no way
        to
        recognize words with our memory to make up logical things, and we are handed over to the sound of the space
        where
        time is deconstructed.

        So, is this more an act of repetition to smooth out his stutter and strive for perfection? Or can we see the
        hidden beauty of Lucier deconstructing our linear understanding of the alphabet and human speech sounds.
        Whereas
        man can only express himself discursively within a chronological sequence based on the dimension of time, with
        the
        deconstruction of the language, we aren’t able to perceive words, there is neither a clear beginning or end,
        nor a
        before and after. This is where time becomes circular.

        <!-- example 2 -->
        In and Out of Sync
        <!-- hier komt plaatje -->





        Gonzalez-Torres' work Untitled (Perfect Lovers) consists of two perfectly in sync clocks hanging next to each
        other. Gonzales gave detailed instructions for the display of the clocks, which became an important element of
        the
        piece itself. The clocks must be of exactly the same dimensions and design/type. The clocks must also be set
        to
        the exact same time. If one or both of the clocks stops functioning, the clocks are deinstalled and repaired,
        then
        reinstalled and reset to the same time. These instructions allows the piece to last forever and to be
        infinite.
        These perfectly in sync clocks will eventually fall out of sync due to their individual mechanisms and battery
        lives. The work refers to a lifespan of two lovers: one will die first. It symbolizes the natural course of
        relationships and the passage of time, where perfect unity eventually falls into divergence and loss. We have
        no
        control over time. Time is dominant and we are its servants.

        The work however needs humans to correct and perfect it. Have we become the machines here to keep it running
        perfect? It is interesting to look at how this work may represent the short-lived nature of life, where we as
        humans are trying to perfect it knowing that eventually there will be an end. Rather than accepting it, we go
        against the concept of our lives ending. We allow time to be reset. There is no room for accepting that the
        life
        has come to an end, only the restriction of infinity. Therefore, this work gives a very interesting
        perspective of
        how we view the short-lived nature of human life, in contrast with that of the unknown duration of the human
        species itself.

        <!-- example 3 -->
        Expectations of Events
        4’33 is a modernist composition composed in 1952 by John Cage. It was composed for any instrument or
        combination
        of instruments. The musical score instructs performers not to play their instruments during the entire
        duration of
        the piece throughout the three movements.

        The piece was first called the “silent piece,” it was to make people listen. “There’s no such thing as
        silence,”
        Cage said, at the première. “You could hear the wind stirring outside during the first movement. During the
        second, raindrops began pattering the roof, and during the third people themselves made all kinds of
        interesting
        sounds as they talked or walked out.”23

        The first time Cage performed it he seated himself at a piano and placed a score on the stand, set a
        stopwatch,
        closed the lid and sat quietly for 33 seconds. Briefly opening and then re-shutting the lid, re-setting the
        stopwatch and sat for two minutes and 40 seconds. He repeated the process, this time for one minute 20
        seconds.
        Finally, he stood, bowed to polite applause from the remaining audience and walked off stage.24

        The total duration of the three-movement ‘silent piece’ was in total 4 minutes and 33 seconds and that’s where
        it
        got its name 4’33.
        <!-- hier komt plaatje -->





        Cage’s score is such an interesting work because of the interplay between the performer(s) and the audience.
        The
        performer(s) knows the score, but doesn’t know the duration. And the viewer holds an expectation, of a
        beginning.
        This is where the tension lies: in the unknowing, and the waiting. A feeling of impatience arises. Earlier we
        established that individuals can experience time differently, it can slow down or speed up. In this work the
        waiting can make it feel like time is going slower, as if it is stretching out. We are expecting something,
        something that should have started at a certain time. We lose our patience and try to fill the time of
        waiting, by
        talking, moving around or leaving.

        These expectations go hand in hand with our clock time. As we saw earlier in Mumford’s text, the clock
        indicates
        structure and punctuality. As he said “…one ate, not upon feeling hungry, but when prompted by the clock: one
        slept, not when one was tired, but when the clock sanctioned it”.25 This work is a beautiful illustration of
        how
        we became servants of the clock. We see how we have lost the power to experience the beauty of the silence
        caused
        by a lack of events. Being so hooked on this given clock-time, expectations overrule, and time seems to pass
        by
        slower.

        Time in Space, Space in Time

        Hans Ulrich asked: ‘What if having an exhibition is not a way to occupy space, but a way to occupy time?26’

        Performance and concerts don’t represent this. They have a specific duration and often unfold in linear time.
        They
        are rather an example of forms of time limitations where there is a set time slot so that everything runs
        smoothly
        within the given time moving forward to the end of the event/happening. Looking at the work 5 weeks, 25 days,
        175
        hours by Maria Eichborn, one could say that the time frame of the exhibition can also be seen as this time
        limitation.27 But in my eyes, this exhibition is an exact repetition where an exhibition is not a way to
        occupy
        space but a way to occupy time.

        In Eichhorn's exhibition 5 weeks, 25 days, 175 hours, none of Chisenhale’s employees will work during the
        period
        of the exhibition and the gallery and office will be closed, implementing ‘free time’ in the place of work. It
        is
        an act of anti-clock, against our capitalistic feeling of having to be productive. Work can also consist of
        doing
        nothing. This is a great example of how time becomes the most important element rather than the space. This
        connects to what Hans Ulrich proposes.

        Conclusion

        Time has no unity, there are different definitions of time; scientific time or clock time and time felt.
        Therefore, the meaning of time can always be questioned. There are no clear conclusions on how humans
        experience
        time. But there is a general understanding of the order of time, with the future in front of us and the past
        behind. We most often see time as clock time. But this clock time is constructed by man as a tool, a machine
        to
        control and perfect, and it has caused us to live life as the servants of the clock. This time made our entire
        way
        of thinking linear. Where we have come to construct everything around us, in this linear way. But linear time
        is
        just clock time, created to serve a capitalistic world.

        Time has become a boundary and art should act as its liberation.

        In Lucier’s work I am sitting in a room, our linear understanding of language is being deconstructed, and we
        enter
        a state of circularity. In his work Untitled (Perfect Lovers) Gonzales plays with our inclination to perfect
        time
        where we try to look beyond our own lifespan and enter an idea of infinity. Cage’s score 4’33 illustrates how
        we
        are trapped in clock-time, acting as its servants. Being so hooked on this given time, expectations overrule
        and
        time seems to pass by slower.

        If time can be seen as something that slows down, is circular, goes beyond a human life span, and also has the
        ability to overpower space, then the anti-clock should be a medium. If the anti-clock would be a medium it
        could
        be thought and played with to raise questions about our perceptions of time. I find it weird to think that we
        don’t get time taught as a medium, but rather as this form of happenings, as limitations and/or deadlines,
        where
        we have learned to live by these guidelines of punctuality.

        If we are able to find the beauty of the anti-clock in art, we should be able to implement it in our
        technological
        society. We can look at the ideology behind quantum physics as an act of liberation for our technological
        world
        where things happen linearly. Quantum physics introduces the possibility that things can happen simultaneously
        and
        are not bound to a specific time and place. This to reflect on a new way of looking at our world instead of
        being
        limited to our linear clock time. By this, we can learn to look differently at time. This opens up the
        question;
        How can this new perspective be implemented into our society?

        Time is not bound to the clock nor are we.
